Python Pandas 

	The term "Pandas" is a open source library for manipulation high-performance data in python.  The name of Pandas ensures Processing, Restructuring, Cleaning, Merging etc... It is necessary for data analysis, 

Before Pandas, Python was able for information planning, however it just offered help of information analysis. It improves the data analysis capabilities. Regardless of the source of data, it can carry out the cruicial steps for data processing. 

Key Features of Pandas

	It has a DataFrame object that is quick and effective, with both standard and custom indexing

	Utilized for reshaping and turning of the information indexes

	For aggregations and transformations, group the data

	Manage the data sets multiple operations, including subsetting, slicing, filtering, groupBy, reordering and reshaping

	It incorporates with different libraries like SciPy and scikit

Pandas is having major 2 units known as 

(I) Series

(ii) Data Frame

To start with pandas, we need to import as

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


Series : It is a one-dimensional array capable of storing variety of data types is how it is defined. 

The data will be either List, Dictionary, Scalar value

You can create a Series in Panda as

Series()

We need to import pandas and numpy libraries with alias, Then we have taken a variable named to store the array of values.  These values to be converted into Pandas Series using pd.Series() method. The Series has printed by calling print() method 

Python Pandas DataFrame

It is generally utilized information-design of pandas and works with two-layered with name.  This method for storing data, Dataframe has dictinct indexes as row index and column index

In Pandas Series, we have various options as

Series.index  : It defines the Series for indexes 

Series.shape : It returns the tuple of shape on data

Series.dtype : It returns the data type of data

Series.size : It returns size of the data

Series.itemsize
