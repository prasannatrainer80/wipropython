What are functions

types of functions

returnable
non-returnable
recursive
lambda functions
functions with *args
functions with *kvargs
Scope of variables
Indexing, Slicing
NumPy
Arrays and Operations

A python function is a block of code, that is reusable and performs a single, related action.  Functions provide better modularity for your application and high degree of code of reusing.

There are various types of functions in python as

(I) Built-In Functions 

	Python standard library includes number of built-in functions.  Some of python's built-in functions are print(), sum(), len()
These are functions available by default

(ii) Functions with Built-In Modules 

	The standard library also bundles the no.of modules like strings, numbers etc...

(iii) User-Defined Functions 

	In addition to the built-in functions we can create our own defined functions. 

Default Arguments : 
You can assign default values to the corresponding function parameters. If you don't pass any value, the default argument will be executed. 

Default argument must be last argument, 


Arbitrary or Variable-length Arguments

You may need to process a function for more arguments than you specified while defining a function. These arguments are called variable-length arguments. Sometimes we don't known how many values to be passed within a method, 

Example : If I have one method as attendance


Python can accept multiple keyword arguments, better known as **kwargs

This concept is known as variable length keyword arguments.

Recursion : If a function calls itself known as recursion. But its highly time complexing 
algorithm.
