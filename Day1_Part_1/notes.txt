1) What is Python

	Python is a general purpose, dynamically type, high-level, compiled and interpreted  purely object
oriented programming language that supports functional programming. 

2) Why Python

	By using Python, we can make any kind of application like 

		(I) Console Application

		(ii) Windows Application

		(iii) Web Application

		 (iv) Mobile Application

		(v) Service Oriented Application

		(vi) It supports all object oriented programming features 

		
		(vii) Python is having nice concept known as packages (or) Modules 


3) Python Features


  	-> Interpreted : 

			Python programs are interpreted, as executed line by line

	-> Interactive
			We have provision in python that we can prompt and take input from user
				and perform dynamic operations. 

	-> Object Oriented : 

			Python completely supports object oriented programming features 

	-> Standard Library 
			Python built-in libraries are portable, cross platform compatible

	-> GUI Support 
			Python supports GUI based programming, where we can create controls 
				and write event-driven code

	-> Scalable
			It provides better structure and support for large programs

	-> Database : 
			Python supports to interact with databases. 


DataTypes : 
_______________

Numeric
	
	integer, float, complex values are stored in python numbers as data-type

Boolean 

	True or False data to be stored

Sequence

	The string can be defined as the sequence of characters represented in the quotation marks

		+ used for concatenation
		* used for repetition

List : 

	-> List is an ordered sequence of items. 

	-> All the items in the list do not need to be of same data type

	-> Items are separated by comma operation within [] 

	["Mohan","Nandini",12,"Bala","Trisha"]

Lists are mutable, means we can change the values. 

Tuple

	Tuples are similar to Lists

	Tuples to be specified in () 

	Tuples are immutable, as they cannot be modified

	Tuples are used to write-protect data and are usually faster than lists as they cannot change dynamically

	(12,44,233,22)

	("Nandini","Abha","Arjit")


Set : Used to store unique elements,

	if you want to remove duplicate entries then set collection is best

	it would be specified using {}

	names={"Mohan","Nandini","Sindhu","Bala","Kiran"};

	names={"Mohan","Nandini","Sindhu","Bala","Kiran","Mohan","Bala","Nandini"};

Dictionary

	Used to store data w.r.t. Key/Value Pairs 

	It generally used when we have huge amount of data

	employ_info = {
			"Mohan","Raj",
			"Thrisha","GS"
			"Raj","Kishore"
		      }

        student_info = {
			"1","Debashis",
			"2","Nandini",	
			"3","Sindhu",
			"4","Bala"
		}


print() : used to display any value or message

input() : Used to read input from the keyboard.

sname="K Nandini"

id() : This function allows you to display the memory location address number

type() : Used to display data type of particular variable

In Python we have casting functions, which allows you to cast one data type to another data type

int()  : used to convert into integer type

float() : Used to convert into float type

str()  : Used to convert into string type

format() : This function allows you to display data w.r.t. Specific format, as with connection strings.
